# Motion Simulator

## Project Overview

**Motion Simulator** is an advanced project that brings an immersive and realistic experience to gaming by simulating motion. This project utilizes force data extracted from game engines through the X-Sim application, which is then processed and sent to an Arduino board. The Arduino board controls DC motor drivers and receives feedback from potentiometers to accurately position the motors' driveshafts. The motion is powered by two robust 24V windshield wiper motors sourced from a truck.

## How It Works

1. **Data Extraction**: The X-Sim application extracts force data from the game engine in real-time.
2. **Data Transmission**: The extracted data is sent to the Arduino board via a serial connection.
3. **Motor Control**: The Arduino processes the data and sends commands to the DC motor drivers to control the motion.
4. **Position Feedback**: Potentiometers attached to the motors provide feedback on the position of the driveshafts, ensuring accurate motion simulation.
5. **Motion Simulation**: The 24V windshield wiper motors translate the commands into physical motion, creating an immersive gaming experience.
